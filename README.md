# Decentralized Gaming DAO Governance Analysis ðŸ”—ðŸŽ®

Welcome to my repository exploring **decentralized governance mechanisms in gaming DAOs** using graph databases, AI, and blockchain technologies.

---

## Project Overview  
**Domain**: In-Game DAO Governance  
**Core Objective**: Build transparent, fair, and anti-manipulation frameworks for decentralized decision-making in gaming communities.  

### Key Problems Addressed:  
1. **Guild Collusion**: Detecting coordinated voting patterns among clans.  
2. **Token Imbalance**: Identifying players/guilds with excessive governance power.  
3. **Sybil Attacks**: Flagging fake accounts influencing proposals.  
4. **Low Participation**: Analyzing voter turnout and casual player representation.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j (Cypher queries, AuraDB)  
- **AI/ML**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLMs (GPT-4, LangChain)  
- **Data Pipeline**: CSV-to-graph ETL, Synthetic data generation with AI  
- **Tools**: Python

## Featured Work  

### 1. **DAO Voting Power Analysis**  
- **Graph Structure**: Modeled `User`, `Guild`, `Proposal`, and `Token` nodes with relationships like `VOTED_FOR` and `HOLDS_TOKEN`.  
- **Key Insight**: Calculated voting power using token amounts Ã— governance scores to flag imbalances.  

### 2. **Collusion Detection**  
- Identified guilds where members vote identically on proposals using path analysis.  
- Example Query:  
  ```cypher
  MATCH (g:Guild)<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(u:User)-[:VOTED_FOR]->(p:Proposal)
  RETURN g.name, p.title, COUNT(u) AS alignedVotes ORDER BY alignedVotes DESC

###  3. AI-Augmented Governance
Integrated RAG chatbots to answer governance queries using Neo4j data.

Use Case: "Which proposals did EpicGuild create?" â†’ Bot retrieves linked proposals and voting trends.
